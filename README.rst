HydrantFC
=========


Hydrant aims to simplify and accelerate the development and maintenance of workflows for `FireCloud <http://firecloud.org>`_.  FireCloud aims to provide a secure global infrastructure for collaborative, extreme-scale biomedical analysis and data sharing.  Hydrant is important because FireCloud brings together a substantial range of related technologies; and for typical researchers, many of whom may not be software engineers or computer scientists, the complexity of learning and effectively utilizing this technology stack can be a daunting barrier to achieving their main goal: **sharing and exploring research data, and running scientific codes upon that data, at scale.**  
The draft specification for Hydrant is given `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnfnW1kQRL_At4cG09xtgUMfx7wxk_DHIdEetLD3EC8>`_, while the installation guide and additional documentation may be found on the `wiki <https://github.com/broadinstitute/HydrantFC/wiki>`_.  The main commands Hydrant offers are shown as red in the flowchart below.  At the command line, use **hydrant --help** for information on these other commands, or **hydrant tutorial** for a brief introduction.
