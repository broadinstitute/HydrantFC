Hydrant aims to simplify and accelerate the development and maintenance of workflows for `FireCloud <http://firecloud.org>`_.  FireCloud aims to provide a secure global infrastructure for collaborative, extreme-scale biomedical analysis and data sharing.  Hydrant is important because FireCloud brings together a substantial range of related technologies; and for typical researchers, many of whom may not be software engineers or computer scientists, the complexity of learning and effectively utilizing this technology stack can be a daunting barrier to achieving their main goal: sharing and exploring research data, and running scientific codes upon that data, at scale.  Here's an outline of the main commands Hydrant offers, and the flow of how they are typically utilized:
