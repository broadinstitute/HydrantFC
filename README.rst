HydrantFC
=========


Hydrant aims to simplify and accelerate the development and maintenance of workflows for `FireCloud <http://firecloud.org>`_.  FireCloud aims to provide a global infrastructure for collaborative, extreme-scale biomedical analysis and data sharing.  Hydrant is important because FireCloud brings together a substantial range of related technologies; and for typical researchers, many of whom may not be software engineers or computer scientists, the complexity of learning and effectively utilizing this technology stack can be a daunting barrier to achieving their main goal: sharing and exploring research data, and running scienitfic codes upon that data, at scale.

A nascent specification (including flowchart) for Hydrant is given `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnfnW1kQRL_At4cG09xtgUMfx7wxk_DHIdEetLD3EC8>`_.

Further documetation and installation guide may be found on the `wiki <https://github.com/broadinstitute/HydrantFC/wiki>`_.
